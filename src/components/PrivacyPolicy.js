            <h4>Data Controller and Data Processor</h4>
            <p>
              Lemapp does not own, control or direct the use of any of the
              Client Data stored or processed by a Client or User via the
              Service. Only the Client or Users are entitled to access, retrieve
              and direct the use of such Client Data. Lemapp is largely unaware
              of what Client Data is actually being stored or made available by
              a Client or User to the Service and does not directly access such
              Client Data except as authorized by the Client, or as necessary to
              provide Services to the Client and its Users.
              <br />
              Because Lemapp does not collect or determine the use of any
              Personal Data contained in the Client Data and because it does not
              determine the purposes for which such Personal Data is collected,
              the means of collecting such Personal Data, or the uses of such
              Personal Data, Lemapp is not acting in the capacity of data
              controller in terms of the European-Union’s General Data
              Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679, “GDPR”) and does
              not have the associated responsibilities under the GDPR. Lemapp
              should be considered only as a processor on behalf of its Clients
              and Users as to any Client Data containing Personal Data that is
              subject to the requirements of the GDPR. Except as provided in
              this Privacy Policy, Lemapp does not independently cause Client
              Data containing Personal Data stored in connection with the
              Services to be transferred or otherwise made available to third
              parties, except to third party subcontractors who may process such
              data on behalf of Lemapp in connection with Lemapp ’s provision of
              Services to Clients. Such actions are performed or authorized only
              by the applicable Client or User.
              <br />
              The Client or the User is the data controller under the Regulation
              for any Client Data containing Personal Data, meaning that such
              party controls the manner such Personal Data is collected and used
              as well as the determination of the purposes and means of the
              processing of such Personal Data.
              <br />
              Lemapp is not responsible for the content of the Personal Data
              contained in the Client Data or other information stored on its
              servers (or its subcontractors’ servers) at the discretion of the
              Client or User nor is Lemapp responsible for the manner in which
              the Client or User collects, handles disclosure, distributes or
              otherwise processes such information.

              <h5>Data Retention</h5>
              <p>
                We only retain the Personal Data collected from a User for as
                long as the User’s account is active or otherwise for a limited
                period of time as long as we need it to fulfill the purposes for
                which we have initially collected it, unless otherwise required
                by law. We will retain and use information as necessary to
                comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce
                our agreements as follows:

                  the date of closure.

                <li>backups are kept for 12 months.</li>
                <li>

              <h5>Fair Information Practices</h5>
              <p>
                The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of
                privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include
                have played a significant role in the development of data
                protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair
                Information Practice Principles and how they should be
                implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws
                that protect personal information.
                <br />
                <span style={{ fontWeight: "500" }}>
                  In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will
                  take the following responsive action, should a data breach
                  occur:
                </span>
                <br />
                We will notify you via email or via in-site notification within
                7 business days. We also agree to the Individual Redress
                Principle which requires that individuals have the right to
                legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and
                processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle
                requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights
                against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to
                courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute
                non-compliance by data processors.
